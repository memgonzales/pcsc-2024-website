                            Quantum computing is a fast-emerging field that has
                            the potential to revolutionize the way we approach
                            solving difficult computing problems in different
                            domains. Instead of suppressing non-classical
                            effects, this computing paradigm embraces quantum
                            mechanical effects as a potential source of
                            advantages in solving problems. In this talk,
                            participants will be introduced to the elementary
                            concepts and mathematical abstractions of operators
                            and operands in quantum computing. Some early
                            quantum algorithms will be presented to illustrate
                            the interplay between these concepts. The circuit
                            model of computation will also be used in
                            representing the process of quantum computation.
                            This talk will provide participants with sufficient
                            theoretical background necessary to appreciate an
                            introductory presentation on writing computer
                            programs for quantum processing units and quantum
                            circuit simulators.
